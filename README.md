# slideslive-converter
Convert the zip archive of a slideslive talk to a single picture-in-picture video.

The resulting video will be cut in exactly the way it was arranged in slideslive.
You may choose a spot in which the speaker video is integrated as an overlay. 

## Instructions

- Download the zip archive of the version you want to use BEFORE SUBMITTING
- Extract the archive
- Change settings in `convert.py` as needed
- Run `python3 convert.py <path-of-extracted-folder>`

If you already submitted, you may be able to download the needed video snippets and json file from your share link individually. This script should still be able to work with those.
